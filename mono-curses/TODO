Things that should be done:
	
	* Switch the main loop in gui.cs to use mainloop.cs
	
	* Make some of the virtual methods that are part of the GUI
	  infrastructure protected, no point in having ProcessEvent,
	  HandleKey and so on be public.
	
	* Expose x, y, w, h into properties and have those trigger
	  repaints if changed.
	
	* Rename?  those to Width, Height?
