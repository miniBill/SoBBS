mono-curses
===========

	The goal of this library was to bind curses.  There is a
	low-level binding in binding.cs and a few chunks in handles.cs
	that provide a basic abstraction.

	The focus of this work though has been on a simple GUI toolkit
	for writing desktop applications, inspired on the 15 year old
	work that I did for the Midnight Commander (you can tell I
	like those colors). 

	The work in `gui' does not take advantage of curses "WINDOWS"
	or the Panel library as am not familiar with them, instead we
	create our own abstraction here. 

License
=======

	Console sharp is an ncurses binding licensed under the terms
	of the MIT X11 license.

Features
========

	Detects window changes, invokes event for widgets to relayout if
	the user wishes to.

	Hotkeys (Alt-letter) are handled by buttons and a handful others.

	Dialog boxes automatically get centered (even with window size change
	scenarios).

	Entry widget has emacs keybindings.

	ListView widget uses Model/View setup.

	Color and black and white support (first parameter to Application.Init)

TODO
====

	* Rename x,y,w,h into something better, expose rects?
	* Merge Widget and Container?
	* Add scrollbar and thumb to listviews
	* Add text view widget
	* Add scrollable control
	* Checkbox/Radio button are missing
	* Date/Time widget
	* Process widget
	* Command line parsing to demo (to active B&W support).
	* Implement Layout managers, which?

	* Write a manual/tutorial

Implementation Notes
====================

	The initial implementation used SafeHandles, but since
	SafeHandles only became available in recent versions of Mono,
	I have switched the code to use IntPtrs for now, and will go
	back to it when newer versions of Mono become more wildly
	available.
