	* gui.cs: ProcessColdKey is broadcast to all widgets just like
	ProcessHotKey, but after ProcessKey instead of before.

	This method is now used by Button to implement default-button
	logic.  This prevents a default button from consuming '\n' keys when there is
	another default	button, or some other widget interested in '\n' when it it focused
	(like perhaps a TextArea widget).

	* attrib.c: fixed compilation of constants. Note that mono-curses
